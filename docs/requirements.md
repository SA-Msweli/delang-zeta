# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DeLangZeta is a Web3-native solution that addresses critical issues in AI language data collection: data monopolies, bias, and unfair compensation. The platform leverages ZetaChain's omnichain capabilities to create a single Universal Smart Contract that can orchestrate transactions across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other connected chains. This creates a transparent, community-driven ecosystem where contributors are fairly rewarded for high-quality language data. The system integrates Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI-powered verification, Google Cloud Storage for caching, and decentralized storage to ensure scalability and data integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data contributor, I want to submit language data for verification and earn DATA_TOKEN rewards, so that I can be fairly compensated for my valuable contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contributor submits language data THEN the system SHALL store the data hash on-chain and raw data on decentralized storage
2. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL trigger automated AI verification using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for quality assessment
3. WHEN data passes initial AI verification THEN the system SHALL queue it for community validation
4. WHEN data is fully verified THEN the system SHALL distribute rewards to the contributor in their preferred supported network token (BTC, ETH, ZETA, etc.)
5. IF data fails verification THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback and allow resubmission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an organization, I want to create and fund language data collection tasks, so that I can obtain specific datasets for my AI/ML projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization creates a task THEN the system SHALL accept payment in any supported network token (BTC, ETH, ZETA, USDC, etc.) and task specification details
2. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL store task metadata on the ZetaChain Universal Smart Contract
3. WHEN a task is funded THEN the system SHALL escrow the payment in the original token until task completion
4. WHEN task requirements are met THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute rewards to contributors in their preferred supported network tokens
5. IF a task expires unfulfilled THEN the system SHALL refund the escrowed tokens to the organization in the original payment token

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a validator, I want to stake DATA_TOKEN and verify submitted data quality, so that I can earn validation rewards while maintaining platform integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user stakes DATA_TOKEN THEN the system SHALL register them as an eligible validator
2. WHEN data requires validation THEN the system SHALL randomly assign it to staked validators
3. WHEN validators reach consensus on data quality THEN the system SHALL update the contributor's reputation score
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL distribute validation rewards proportional to stake in the validator's preferred supported network token
5. IF validators provide malicious or incorrect validation THEN the system SHALL slash their staked tokens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want to license verified language datasets through the marketplace, so that I can access high-quality, diverse data for my AI applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a consumer browses the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display available datasets with quality metrics
2. WHEN a consumer purchases a license THEN the system SHALL process payment in any supported network token and grant access
3. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL provide API keys and download permissions
4. WHEN a license expires THEN the system SHALL revoke access automatically
5. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and provide clear error messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DAO member, I want to participate in platform governance by voting on proposals, so that I can help shape the platform's future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a governance token holder creates a proposal THEN the system SHALL require minimum token threshold and proposal details
2. WHEN a proposal is submitted THEN the system SHALL initiate a voting period with clear deadlines
3. WHEN eligible voters cast votes THEN the system SHALL weight votes by token holdings
4. WHEN voting period ends THEN the system SHALL automatically execute approved proposals
5. IF a proposal fails to meet quorum THEN the system SHALL mark it as failed and allow resubmission

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to interact with a user-friendly web interface, so that I can easily contribute data, validate submissions, and manage my rewards without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL authenticate and display their dashboard
2. WHEN a user navigates the platform THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive UI for all core functions
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and transaction status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
5. IF the user is offline THEN the system SHALL cache actions and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor platform health and performance metrics, so that I can ensure optimal operation and identify issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL log all critical transactions and state changes
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL store them for analysis and alerting
3. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts to administrators
4. WHEN smart contracts are upgraded THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and data integrity
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user from any blockchain ecosystem, I want to interact with DeLangZeta using my preferred chain's native tokens, so that I can participate without needing to bridge assets manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pays with Bitcoin THEN the ZetaChain Universal Smart Contract SHALL accept BTC for task sponsorship and marketplace purchases
2. WHEN a user pays with Ethereum tokens THEN the system SHALL process ETH/ERC-20 payments through ZetaChain's omnichain functionality
3. WHEN users earn rewards THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify their preferred payout network (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
4. WHEN cross-chain transactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain atomic execution across all involved chains
5. IF cross-chain operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper rollback mechanisms to prevent fund loss

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want verified language data to be stored in Google Cloud for LLM training and future analysis, so that I can access high-quality datasets for machine learning applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data passes verification THEN the system SHALL store the verified language data in Google Cloud Storage buckets
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL organize it by language, data type, and quality metrics for easy access
3. WHEN LLM training datasets are requested THEN the system SHALL provide structured access to Google Cloud stored data
4. WHEN future tasks require historical data THEN the system SHALL enable querying and analysis of previously collected data
5. IF data privacy requirements exist THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls and anonymization in Google Cloud

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to leverage Google Cloud services for enhanced performance and AI capabilities, so that the platform can scale efficiently and provide intelligent data processing.
