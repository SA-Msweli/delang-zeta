# DeLangZeta Documentation

This directory contains the complete specification and documentation for the DeLangZeta platform - a Web3-native decentralized language data collection platform built on ZetaChain's omnichain infrastructure.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Requirements](./requirements.md)** - Complete feature requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **[Design](./design.md)** - Comprehensive technical design document with architecture and component specifications
- **[Implementation Plan](./tasks.md)** - Detailed task breakdown for development execution

## Project Overview

DeLangZeta addresses critical issues in AI language data collection: data monopolies, bias, and unfair compensation. The platform leverages ZetaChain's Universal Smart Contracts to create a truly omnichain application that operates seamlessly across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and other connected networks.

### Key Features

- **Universal Payments**: Users can sponsor tasks using BTC, ETH, USDC, or any supported token from their preferred network
- **Cross-Chain Rewards**: Contributors receive payments directly to Bitcoin addresses, Ethereum wallets, or any supported network
- **No Manual Bridging**: All cross-chain operations handled automatically by ZetaChain's protocol
- **AI-Powered Verification**: Integration with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent data quality assessment
- **Secure Serverless Architecture**: Google Cloud Functions for secure API access and authentication
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive web application optimized for all devices

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: ZetaChain Universal Smart Contracts with omnichain functionality
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Progressive Web App features
- **Backend**: Google Cloud Functions (serverless architecture)
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, Translate API, Speech-to-Text API
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage with secure access controls
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with wallet signature verification

## Getting Started
